# Introduction
This is a crawler program written in javascript. It allows you to download all the images from a discord server channel.  
Unlike other programs, this program use puppeter to get the url of the image and download it when the client sending a discord request of attachments.  
Even though it was much safer than selfbot but I still won't be responsible for any problems with using the software (like getting banned due to the discord TOS).  
~~But is scrolling the pages against the discord TOS? I don't think so.~~

## How to use
Type the [serverID and the channelID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) that you want to scrap for in config.json then start the program. Login with your account manually, sit down and drink a cup of coffee â˜•.
The images will be saved to the "spider" folder.
